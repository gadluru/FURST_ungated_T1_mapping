# Free-breathing Ungated Radial Simultaneous multi-slice cardiac T1 mapping

This repository contains code and example datasets for the paper 'Free-breathing Ungated Radial Simultaneous multi-slice cardiac T1 mapping'. 
Running Recon_UCAIR_ungated.m will reproduce some of the results demonstrated in the paper. This code was developed and tested on a RockLinux 8.6 operating system, 
with an AMD EPYC Milan 7543 32 2.8GHz 256 MB cache, 512 GB RAM, and Nvidia  A100 gpus. Systems with ~64 GB RAM may counter issues with insufficient memory 
that require code changes to reduce memory requirements during certain function calls.
